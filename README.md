## What Is CodeFights?
CodeFights.com is an algorithm testing site to help learn a new language or prepare for a technical interview. It has various modes including standard algorithm problems, interview practice, timed challenges, company bots, and tournaments. Each time you solve a problem, points are awarded and you can move on to the next problem.

## What is the Arcade Section?
The Arcade section is a large part of the static practice problems CodeFights provides. It is a set of 464 algorithm problems. This is currently made up of Intro, Databases, The Core, Python and Graphs.

## How Does CodeFights Work?
- For each problem, a description is provided, along with a small number of test cases that are visible. There are an equal number of test cases that are hidden from view, which can only be passed if your algorithm is correct.
